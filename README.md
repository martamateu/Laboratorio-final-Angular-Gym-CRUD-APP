 ## Basic requirements üîß
 
Gym membership management

It is proposed to generate a form with Angular that allows creating, editing, modifying and deleting a list of gym members.


To carry out this practice, the following aspects must be taken into account:

A "Member" class will be created with the following fields:

ID
Name
Surnames
Member (understood as membership number)
Telephone
Sex (male, female).

2. It must be possible to register new members and view them in a list.

3. There cannot be two partners with the same assigning number. That is, the membership number must be unique.

4. All records must be modifiable.

5. All records must be erasable.

6. angular-material must be used.

7. It will be verified that the DNI has 9 characters.

8. It will be verified that the Name, Surname have at least 3 characters.

9. The gender is to be selected from the values ‚Äã(men, women, neutral).
